# alphasyncelleng
This repository contains code for modeling alpha-synuclein transport for the cell engineering final project.
Directions:
To run the simulation of the connectomics model, open the executable file cellengfinal4.m in MATLAB and run the code.
A figure should result from execution of this script that depicts the simulated change in alpha-synuclein concentration over time 
in the different populations of neurons. In this simulation, five neuron populations are included: enteric neurons, nodose neurons, 
SNpc neurons, hippocampus and striatal neurons. An injection concentration of 1 ug/ml of alpha synuclein is injected into the 
population of enteric neurons for this simulation, and from the graph you can see transport to the other populations over time.
